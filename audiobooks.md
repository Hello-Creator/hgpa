When appropriate, audiobooks are a great alternative to reading. Consuming a book in this way may also serve as a type of screening process - deep books may be read (again) afterwards, but with an intent to deeply analyze its content and take notes.

The following documents the states I'm at with various audiobooks. I also include formal audio programs here. This listening was started in the Summer of 2016.

**Legend**:

## Completed

[Rework](https://www.amazon.com/Rework/dp/B003BLGD06/). Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson. March 2010.

_[The 4-Hour Workweek (Expanded and Updated)](https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Anywhere-Expanded-Updated/dp/B0031KN6T8). Timothy Ferris. December 2009._ Not so much a wake-up call as a hard-hitting reminder. Thanks Tim. üî• ‚úèÔ∏è

[How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.amazon.com/Dale-Carnegies-Radio-Program-popularity/dp/956291206X). Dale Carnegie. 1937. ‚úèÔ∏è

_[Soft Skills](https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Skills-Software-Developers-Manual/dp/B0158SJ3EM). John Sonmez. December 2014._ The title is misleading but in a surprisingly good way. This is not a professional inter-personal  relationship help book - it's a condensed career and lifestyle how-to. Extremely practical with many suggestions that I know work from personal experience. Vast majority of book is applicable to everyone, not just software developers. Fans of Tim Ferris may enjoy this. ‚úèÔ∏è
