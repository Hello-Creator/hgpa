audiobooks -- books in audio form
=================================

When appropriate, audiobooks are a great alternative to reading.
Consuming a book in this way may also serve as a type of screening process.
Books may be consumed again through reading with intent to analyze its content.

The following documents the states I'm at with various audiobooks.
I include formal audio programs here too.
This listening was started sometime in early 2016 but really kicked into gear that summer.

I routinely return here to complete entries and their summaries.

## Completed

[A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra)](http://amzn.to/2fAUcIV). Barbara Oakley. 2014-07-31. Applications on how to learn. Emphasis on STEM but applicable to all knowledge. Every student should read/listen to this book. 🔥 👍 ✏️

[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](http://amzn.to/2fn7oGe). Stephen R. Covey. 2004.✏️

[Super Rich](http://amzn.to/2guhtkz). Russel Simmons. 2010.
Narrated by Black Ice, whose voice expresses conviction well. The topics in this book by "Uncle Rush" may surprise you: spirituality, meditation, veganism, etc. I liked it and encouraged me to take up mediation again.

[The Essence of Success](http://amzn.to/2gupWnB). Earl Nightingale. 1989.
Essentially the best of Earl Nightingale with volumes grouped together by topic spanning his entire collection of recordings. It's great to hear the changes in his voice and personality as he got older. 👍

[Rich Dad, Poor Dad](http://amzn.to/2g5Mwm7). Robert Kiyosaki. 1997.

Fantastic book that unexpectedly touched upon my interests in neurochemistry. 👍

[Rework](http://amzn.to/2guoyBK). Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson. 2010-03. Short and to the point which is part of their philosophy. 👍

[The 4-Hour Workweek (Expanded and Updated)](http://amzn.to/2fALgUg). Timothy Ferris. 2009-12. Not so much a wake-up call as a hard-hitting reminder. Thanks Tim. 🔥 ✏️

[How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://amzn.to/2gujutj). Dale Carnegie. 1937. Classic that deserves study and continued practice. I enjoyed this narrator. 👍 ✏️

[Soft Skills](http://amzn.to/2gumcTb). John Sonmez. 2014-12.
The title is misleading but in a surprisingly good way. This is not a professional inter-personal relationship help book - it's a condensed career and lifestyle how-to. Extremely practical with many suggestions that I know work from personal experience. Vast majority of book is applicable to everyone, not just software developers. Fans of Tim Ferris may enjoy this. 👍 ✏️

[How To Lie With Statistics](http://amzn.to/2guioRX). Darrell Huff. 1954.

Grow Rich Now! Napolean Hill. This was a recording of one of his seminars.

Enthusiastic narrator. Enjoyable. 👍

[The One Minute Manager](http://amzn.to/2g5JhuV). Ken Blanchard & Spencer Johnson. 2015-05-05.

As a Man Thinketh (Earl Nightingale Edit). Originally by James Allen. This recording introduced me to both James Allen and Earl Nightingale. Listening to this was a life-altering event. I have re-listened to it dozens of times and continue to do so every few weeks. I give it my absolute highest recommendation. 👍👍👍 🔥🔥🔥

[The Innovator’s Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail](http://amzn.to/2gukQaW). Clayton M. Christensen. 2011-10-04.

[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](http://amzn.to/2guhVM6). Patrick Lencioni. 2002-04. 👍

[The Hard Thing About Hard Things](http://amzn.to/2g5URGa). Ben Horowitz. 2014-03-04. 👍

[Mastery](http://amzn.to/2gulSE4). Robert Greene. 2013-10-29.
Despite the popularity of _The 48 Laws of Power_ I consider this to be his best work. It encouraged me to begin a rigorous self-apprenticeship, of which these audiobooks are a part of. I only wish I heard something like this 20 years ago. 👍 ✏️
