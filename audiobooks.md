When appropriate, audiobooks are a great alternative to reading. Consuming a book in this way may also serve as a type of screening process - deep books may be read (again) afterwards, but with an intent to deeply analyze its content and take notes.

The following documents the states I'm at with various audiobooks. I also include formal audio programs here.

## Currently Listening

[The Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/B005MM7HY8). Eric Ries. September 2011.

## Queued

[Good to Great](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Some-Companies-Others/dp/B003VXI5MS/). Jim Collins. July 13, 2010.

[Build to Last](https://www.amazon.com/Built-Last-Successful-Visionary-2004-11-02/dp/B01JXUSWRA). Jim Collins. Authors comment that _Good to Great_ should be read/heard first.

## Completed

[Leaders Eat Last: Why Some Teams Pull Together and Others Don't](https://www.amazon.com/Leaders-Eat-Last-Together-Others/dp/B00HQ3K34M/). Simon Sinek. January 7, 2014.

[Rework](https://www.amazon.com/Rework/dp/B003BLGD06/). Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson. March 2010.

[The 4-Hour Workweek (Expanded and Updated)](https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Anywhere-Expanded-Updated/dp/B0031KN6T8). Timothy Ferris. December 2009. Not so much a wake-up call as a hard-hitting reminder. Thanks Tim. ðŸ”¥

[How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.amazon.com/Dale-Carnegies-Radio-Program-popularity/dp/956291206X). Dale Carnegie. 1937.

[Soft Skills](https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Skills-Software-Developers-Manual/dp/B0158SJ3EM). John Sonmez. December 2014. The title is misleading but in a surprisingly good way. This is not a professional relationships help book - it's a lifestyle how-to. Extremely practical with suggestions that I know work from personal experience. Vast majority of book is applicable to everyone, not just software developers. Fans of Tim Ferris will enjoy this.
