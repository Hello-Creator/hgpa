audiobooks -- books in audio form
=================================

When appropriate, audiobooks are a great alternative to reading.
Consuming a book in this way may also serve as a type of screening process.
Books may be consumed again through reading with intent to analyze its content.

The following documents the states I'm at with various audiobooks.
I include formal audio programs here too.
This listening was started sometime in early 2016 but really kicked into gear that summer.

I routinely return here to complete entries and their summaries.

## On Hold

[The Art of Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Learning-Journey-Optimal-Performance/dp/0743277465/). Josh Waitzkin. 2014-04-01. Great autobiography but not what I thought I was going to get.

[Build to Last](https://www.amazon.com/Built-Last-Successful-Visionary-2004-11-02/dp/B01JXUSWRA). Jim Collins. Authors comment that _Good to Great_ should be read/heard first. I started this book but feel I may not truly appreciate it yet.

## Completed

[Communicate what you Think](https://www.amazon.com/Communicate-What-Think-Earl-Nightingale/dp/B002NNOMQK). Earl Nightingale. 

[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Interactive-ebook/dp/B01069X4H0/). Stephen R. Covey. ‚úèÔ∏è

[Super Rich](https://www.amazon.com/Super-Rich/dp/B004HYCLSY/). Russel Simmons. 2010. Narrated by Black Ice, whose voice expresses conviction well. The topics in this book by "Uncle Rush" may surprise you: spirituality, meditation, veganism, etc. I liked it and encouraged me to take up mediation again.

[The Essence of Success](https://www.amazon.com/The-Essence-of-Success/dp/B00OH75IE0/). Earl Nightingale. 1989. Essentially the best of Earl Nightingale with volumes grouped together by topic spanning his entire collection of recordings. It's great to hear the changes in his voice and personality as he got older. Highly recommended.

[Good to Great](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Some-Companies-Others/dp/B003VXI5MS/). Jim Collins. July 13, 2010.

[Rich Dad, Poor Dad](https://www.amazon.com/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/B008BUHTLE/). Robert Kiyosaki. 1997.

[The Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/B005MM7HY8). Eric Ries. September 2011. üî• ‚úèÔ∏è

[Leaders Eat Last: Why Some Teams Pull Together and Others Don't](https://www.amazon.com/Leaders-Eat-Last-Together-Others/dp/B00HQ3K34M/). Simon Sinek. January 7, 2014. Fantastic book that unexpectedly touched upon my interests in neurochemistry. Recommended.

[Rework](https://www.amazon.com/Rework/dp/B003BLGD06/). Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson. March 2010. Short and to the point which is part of their philosophy.

[The 4-Hour Workweek (Expanded and Updated)](https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Anywhere-Expanded-Updated/dp/B0031KN6T8). Timothy Ferris. December 2009. Not so much a wake-up call as a hard-hitting reminder. Thanks Tim. üî• ‚úèÔ∏è

[How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.amazon.com/Dale-Carnegies-Radio-Program-popularity/dp/956291206X). Dale Carnegie. 1937. Classic that deserves study and continued practice. I enjoyed this narrator. ‚úèÔ∏è

[Soft Skills](https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Skills-Software-Developers-Manual/dp/B0158SJ3EM). John Sonmez. December 2014. The title is misleading but in a surprisingly good way. This is not a professional inter-personal relationship help book - it's a condensed career and lifestyle how-to. Extremely practical with many suggestions that I know work from personal experience. Vast majority of book is applicable to everyone, not just software developers. Fans of Tim Ferris may enjoy this. ‚úèÔ∏è

[How To Lie With Statistics](https://www.amazon.com/How-to-Lie-with-Statistics/dp/B01C4RPH8Q). Darrell Huff. 1954.

Grow Rich Now! Napolean Hill.

Who Moved My Cheese? Spencer Johnson. Short but important didactic story. Recommended.

In Defense of Food. Michael Pollan. (Relisten).

[On Negotiating](https://www.amazon.com/Negotiating-Mark-H-McCormack/dp/0787112747/). Mark H. McCormack. May 1997. ‚úèÔ∏è

[How Champions Think](https://www.amazon.com/How-Champions-Think-Sports-Life/dp/1476788642/). Bob Rotella. May 2016. _Audiobook completed August 2016_.

The One Minute Networker. Bryan Thayer.

The One Minute Manager. Ken Blanchard & Spencer Johnson.

As a Man Thinketh (Earl Nightingale Edit). Originally by James Allen. This recording introduced me to both James Allen and Earl Nightingale. Listening to this was a life-altering event. I have re-listened to it dozens of times and continue to do so every few weeks. I give it my absolute highest recommendation. üî•üî•üî•

The Innovators Dilemma. Clayton M. Christensen.

[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756/). Patrick Lencioni. April 2002. _Audiobook completed July 2016_.

The Hard Thing About Hard Things. Ben Horowitz.

[How Google Works](https://www.amazon.com/How-Google-Works-Eric-Schmidt/dp/1455582344). Eric Schmidt & Jonathan Rosenberg. September 2014. _Audiobook completed June 2016_.

High Output Management. Andrew S. Grove. ‚úèÔ∏è

Mastery. Robert Greene. Despite the popularity of _The 48 Laws of Power_ I consider this to be his best work. It encouraged me to begin a rigorous self-apprenticeship, of which these audiobooks are a part of. I only wish I heard something like this 20 years ago. üî•üî• ‚úèÔ∏è
