sorting
=======

Sorting is a fundamental problem in computer science.
Each method of sorting has trade-offs in time and space complexity.

Methods of sorting include:
- bubble sort
- selection sort
- insertion sort
- [merge sort](merge-sort.md)
- quick sort
- bucket sort
- radix sort
- heap sort
- Tim sort
- shell sort

Implementations of sorting algorithms can be tricky. Why?
- is list a continuous array or a linked-list?
- is function pure or does it mutate?
- do we manage memory ourselves?
