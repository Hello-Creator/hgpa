Heaps
=====

## Introduction

Usually the word "heap" refers to an unordered pile of things, a mess.
Many times it refers to a _trash heap_, a pile or fill of garbage.

In computer science, a heap usually refers to two different things:
- the _memory heap_, or area for dynamically allocated memory
- the _heap_ data structure, specifically _binary heaps_

The use of the word "heap" for these may not be a coincidence!
Memory heaps hold dynamically (randomly) allocated memory with no particular order.
Heap data structures do not maintain sequential order of their content.
In other words, in some way, they are each a respective mess.

Furthering the analogy, some programming languages manage the automatic deallocation of memory within a heap with something called a _garbage collector_.

The heap data structure is useful for quickly getting the maximum or minimum element from a set. They are generally associated with priority queues, where the element with the highest priority is always at the front of the line.

You may have also heard of _heapsort_.
This is a sorting algorithm that uses a heap to do all the work.

## Heap Data Structures

_heap-labeled tree_:
- is a binary tree such that each node _dominates_ key labeling of its children
- is a _min-heap_ when node dominates with smaller keys
- is a _max-heap_ when node dominates with larger keys

Usually when we talk about heaps (data structure) we're referring to _binary heaps_.
There are other types as well.

## Introduction to Binary Heaps

Say you have a list of numbers: `2 7 8 1 5 9 3`.

We want to construct a data structure such that we can always get the dominating element in constant time.
In the case of a min-heap it would be `1`.
This implies that all the real work needs to happen on element insertion and deletion.

A binary heap uses a complete binary tree.

Recall that _complete binary trees_:
- have each level filled, with possible exception of last level
- when the last level is incomplete all nodes are filled from the left

**Inserting into a binary heap**:
1. place new element in left most spot (n+1)
2. "Bubble Up": if and while (new) element dominates parent
  - swap them

Swaps happen between levels, and a tree will have lg(n) levels.
Since there are n items to be inserted, insertion will take `O(nlogn)`.

**Extracting the dominator from a binary heap**:
1. remove dominating element from top
2. move last added element (bottom-right most leaf) into top
3. "Bubble Down": if and while that element does not dominate its children:
  - swap it with lesser of two children

### Implementing Binary Heaps

Since a binary heap is a complete binary tree we can implement it using an array.

Example: `2 7 8 1 5 9 3` pushed into min-heap as a tree:
```
    1
  2   3
 7 5 9 8
```

But as an array looks like: `1,2,3,7,5,9,8,`.
Notice this is equivalent to a breadth-first traversal.

So for some zero-based index `i`:
  - left child = `2i + 1`
  - right child = `2i + 2`
  - parent = `floor((i-1) / 2)`

_WARNING: Beware zero and one-based version of the above equations.
Many references use one-based equations because the math/logic is cleaner,
but programmers always use zero-based arrays._

Notice that `floor(n/2)` is the index of one or more the the middle items of the array:
  - `floor(n/2)` if n is odd
  - `floor(n/2)` and `floor(n/2) - 1` if n is even

To insert:
1. append number to list
2. "Bubble Up":
  - `parent = heap[floor((i-1)/2)]`
  - if parent < number then swap them

- Test your inserts
- Test your removals

Note:
  - cannot be efficiently searched because it is not a BST
  - we don't know any facts that will improve a linear search

Heap Interface:
- get the dominating element, e.g. `min` or `max`
- `add` or `insert` an element
- `remove` or `delete` an element

We can store any binary tree in an array without pointers but:
- array still requires empty spots for missing nodes
- methods to save memory make it less flexible
